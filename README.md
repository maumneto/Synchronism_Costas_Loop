# Carrier Synchronism - Costas Loop
Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) - Costas Loop 

# Presentation
A PLL Costas Loop implemented by @maumneto in Simulink MATLAB. A PLL is based circuit which is used for carrier frequency recovery from suppressed-carrier modulation signals.
Some information: 
- Do not need specific libraries or Toolbox;
- There is a phase recovery implementation;
